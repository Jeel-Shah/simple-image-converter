# A Simple BMP to JPEG Converter

This is the source code for a simple BMP to JPEG image converter. It can convert a single file or multiple files. The layout is pretty self explanatory. If you want to run it from command line then `javac ImageConverter_Executor.java` and `javac ImageConverter.java` and then you can just do `java ImageConverter_Executor` and the application will open.

If you are using Eclipse as your IDE of choice, you can `git clone` the project and import using Eclipse. 

You can do whatever you want to do with this code BUT you must provide credit.
